Blueberry pie
===

# Preparation

Baking paper  
Low round baking tray  
Bowl to prepare a dough  
Bowl to prepare a filling  

# Ingredients

500g of quark  
250g of blueberries (can be frozen) - other berries and fruits are also fine (rapsberries are amazing!)  
2 large eggs  
1/2 vanilla puding  
180g of butter  
200g of oats (preferrably grinded)  
200g of grated coconut  
150g of sugar  
1 small package of vanilla sugar (cca 20g)  
pinch of salt  

# Process

Water your baking paper to make it easy to fit to round baking tray - make sure that even walls are protected, the paper should be larger than the tray.
Make butter soft in a microwave around 1 minute, almost completely melted. Combine with all oats, coconut, salt and half of sugar, mix well.
Take 3/4 of the dough and press it firmly into the baking tray, make a nice base and make sure all walls are covered with dough. The thickness should be around 1 cm after applying a pressure.

In second bowl, put all quark, rest of the sugar, vanilla sugar, pudding and eggs - mix it very well together. Pour the liquid into the baking tray with the dough.

Spread evenly all berries on the top. Apply light pressure to make berries half way into liquid quark mixture. It should feel there are too many of blueberries, almost no filling shoudl be visible.

Lastly put remaining 1/4 of the dough and sprinkle it on top of berries - be generous and make it a nice layer, merely all surface should be covered with the dough.

Put into the oven 180oC for 70-75 minutes. It should be almost burned on the edges. Cool it down to room temperature, then put it into a fridge for some time - just to make a result firm, easy to cut.

Enjoy!
